# twitterclone

A Twitter clone created using Dart and Flutter.

## Important Information

This app utilizes Firebase and Flutterfire in order for the login and the authentication. 
Since Firebase does not allow usernames nor passwords under 6 characters, I have decided to change the login credentials. 

Some of the code is from several documentations.

The login credentials are as follows:

Email: admin@admin.com

Password: admin1

I am not sure if this is working as expected to your standards.
